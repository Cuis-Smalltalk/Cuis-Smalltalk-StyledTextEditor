This is the StyledTextEditor project for Cuis, brought to you by Bernhard Pieber and Juan Vuletich.
The design of the Styled Text Editor toolbar and scrollbars was done by Sabine Gasper-Mautes.

Steps to install:
If you want to install StyledTextEditor in an image for the first time do the following steps:
- Uncompress scowl-7.1.tar.gz into the directory where the Cuis image resides
- Start Cuis 4.0, preferably with a VM that includes support for the ExtendedClipboardPlugin (like this: http://www.squeakvm.org/mac/release/Squeak%204.2.5beta1U.zip , currently only on the Mac)
- Install StyledTextInstaller.pck (e.g. using File List > install package)
- Do the following: StyledTextInstaller new install

Steps to update:
If you already installed StyledTextEditor in an image you can update it to a newer version like this:
- Openâ€¦ > Installed Packages
- Save unsaved packages if necessary so that git can merge your changes
